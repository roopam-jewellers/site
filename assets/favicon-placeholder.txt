# Favicon placeholder
# 
# This file serves as a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.
# 
# To create a proper favicon:
# 1. Create a 32x32 pixel icon in ICO format
# 2. Name it favicon.ico
# 3. Place it in the assets/ folder
# 
# You can create favicons using:
# - Favicon.io (https://favicon.io/)
# - Canva
# - GIMP
# - Photoshop
# 
# The favicon should represent your jewellery brand,
# perhaps a simple diamond or jewel icon in your brand colors.
